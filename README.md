SpringQuiz App
SpringQuiz is a straightforward quiz application built on the powerful Spring Boot framework, providing an easy-to-use platform for creating and taking quizzes. 
Whether you're an educator creating assessments or a student looking to reinforce your learning, SpringQuiz offers a seamless and efficient quiz experience.

In the application, endpoints that has the function of saving, deleting, updating, calculating the total result of the user were included. 
MySql Database was used to store the data and map the relationship between the two entities(Question and Quiz). The project opened my understanding to tables
relationships (OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToMany) and also the the use of POJO (plain Old java object) or DTO(Data Transfer Object) to 
transfer data and also restrict access to some fields (QuestionWrapper, Response).

We encourage contributions to enhance the features and usability of SpringQuiz. 
If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or want to contribute to the development, 
please open an issue or submit a pull request.
